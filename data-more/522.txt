Quantum superpositions and entanglement of thermal states at high
  temperatures and their applications to quantum information processing
  We study characteristics of superpositions and entanglement of thermal states
at high temperatures and discuss their applications to quantum information
processing. We introduce thermal-state qubits and thermal-Bell states, which
are a generalization of pure-state qubits and Bell states to thermal mixtures.
A scheme is then presented to discriminate between the four thermal-Bell states
without photon number resolving detection but with Kerr nonlinear interactions
and two single-photon detectors. This enables one to perform quantum
teleportation and gate operations for quantum computation with thermal-state
qubits.
