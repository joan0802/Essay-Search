Fluctuations in glassy systems
  We summarize a theoretical framework based on global time-reparametrization
invariance that explains the origin of dynamic fluctuations in glassy systems.
We introduce the main ideas without getting into much technical details. We
describe a number of consequences arising from this scenario that can be tested
numerically and experimentally distinguishing those that can also be explained
by other mechanisms from the ones that we believe, are special to our proposal.
We support our claims by presenting some numerical checks performed on the 3d
Edwards-Anderson spin-glass. Finally, we discuss up to which extent these ideas
apply to super-cooled liquids that have been studied in much more detail up to
present.
