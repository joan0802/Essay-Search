Substructures in WINGS clusters
  We search for and characterize substructures in the projected distribution of
galaxies observed in the wide field CCD images of the 77 nearby clusters of the
WIde-field Nearby Galaxy-cluster Survey (WINGS). This sample is complete in
X-ray flux in the redshift range 0.04<z<0.07. We search for substructures in
WINGS clusters with DEDICA, an adaptive-kernel procedure. We test the procedure
on Monte-Carlo simulations of the observed frames and determine the reliability
for the detected structures. DEDICA identifies at least one reliable structure
in the field of 55 clusters. 40 of these clusters have a total of 69
substructures at the same redshift of the cluster (redshift estimates of
substructures are from color-magnitude diagrams). The fraction of clusters with
subclusters (73%) is higher than in most studies. The presence of subclusters
affects the relative luminosities of the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs).
Down to L ~ 10^11.2 L_Sun, our observed differential distribution of subcluster
luminosities is consistent with the theoretical prediction of the differential
mass function of substructures in cosmological simulations.
