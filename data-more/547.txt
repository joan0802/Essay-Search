Neutrinos and Non-proliferation in Europe
  Triggered by the demand of the IAEA, neutrino physicists in Europe involved
with the Double Chooz experiment are studying the potential of neutrino
detection to monitor nuclear reactors. In particular a new set of experiments
at the ILL is planned to improve the knowledge of the neutrino spectrum emitted
in the fission of 235U and 239Pu.
