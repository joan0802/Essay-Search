Compatibility of Exotic States with Neutron Star Observation
  We consider the effect of hard core repulsion in the baryon-baryon
interaction at short distance to the properties of a neutron star. We obtain
that, even with hyperons in the interior of a neutron star, the neutron star
mass can be as large as $\sim 2 M_\odot$.
