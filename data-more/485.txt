Kinematic Decoupling of Globular Clusters with Extended
  Horizontal-Branch
  About 25% of the Milky Way globular clusters (GCs) exhibit unusually extended
color distribution of stars in the horizontal-branch (HB) phase. This
phenomenon is now best understood as due to the presence of helium enhanced
second generation subpopulations, which has raised a possibility that these
peculiar GCs might have a unique origin. Here we show that these GCs with
extended HB are clearly distinct from other normal GCs in kinematics and mass.
The GCs with extended HB are more massive than normal GCs, and are dominated by
random motion with no correlation between kinematics and metallicity.
Surprisingly, however, when they are excluded, most normal GCs in the inner
halo show clear signs of dissipational collapse that apparently led to the
formation of the disk. Normal GCs in the outer halo share their kinematic
properties with the extended HB GCs, which is consistent with the accretion
origin. Our result further suggests heterogeneous origins of GCs, and we
anticipate this to be a starting point for more detailed investigations of
Milky Way formation, including early mergers, collapse, and later accretion.
