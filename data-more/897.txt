Higher spin algebras as higher symmetries
  The exhaustive study of the rigid symmetries of arbitrary free field theories
is motivated, along several lines, as a preliminary step in the completion of
the higher-spin interaction problem in full generality. Some results for the
simplest example (a scalar field) are reviewed and commented along these lines.
