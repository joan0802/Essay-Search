A unified approach to SIC-POVMs and MUBs
  A unified approach to (symmetric informationally complete) positive operator
valued measures and mutually unbiased bases is developed in this article. The
approach is based on the use of operator equivalents expanded in the enveloping
algebra of SU(2). Emphasis is put on similarities and differences between
SIC-POVMs and MUBs.
