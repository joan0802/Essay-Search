On Equivariant Embedding of Hilbert C^* modules
  We prove that an arbitrary (not necessarily countably generated) Hilbert
$G$-$\cla$ module on a G-C^* algebra $\cla$ admits an equivariant embedding
into a trivial $G-\cla$ module, provided G is a compact Lie group and its
action on $\cla$ is ergodic.
