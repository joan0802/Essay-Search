Fractional WKB Approximation
  Wentzel, Kramers, Brillouin (WKB) approximation for fractional systems is
investigated in this paper using the fractional calculus. In the fractional
case the wave function is constructed such that the phase factor is the same as
the Hamilton's principle function "S". To demonstrate our proposed approach two
examples are investigated in details.
