LRS Bianchi Type-V Viscous Fluid Universe With a Time Dependent
  Cosmological Term $\Lambda$
  An LRS Bianchi type-V cosmological models representing a viscous fluid
distribution with a time dependent cosmological term $\Lambda$ is investigated.
To get a determinate solution, the viscosity coefficient of bulk viscous fluid
is assumed to be a power function of mass density. It turns out that the
cosmological term $\Lambda(t)$ is a decreasing function of time, which is
consistent with recent observations of type Ia supernovae. Various physical and
kinematic features of these models have also been explored.
