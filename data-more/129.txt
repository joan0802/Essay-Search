New simple modular Lie superalgebras as generalized prolongs
  Over algebraically closed fields of characteristic p>2, prolongations of the
simple finite dimensional Lie algebras and Lie superalgebras with Cartan matrix
are studied for certain simplest gradings of these algebras. Several new simple
Lie superalgebras are discovered, serial and exceptional, including superBrown
and superMelikyan superalgebras. Simple Lie superalgebras with Cartan matrix of
rank 2 are classified.
