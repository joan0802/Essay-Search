Braiding transformation, entanglement swapping and Berry phase in
  entanglement space
  We show that braiding transformation is a natural approach to describe
quantum entanglement, by using the unitary braiding operators to realize
entanglement swapping and generate the GHZ states as well as the linear cluster
states. A Hamiltonian is constructed from the unitary
$\check{R}_{i,i+1}(\theta,\phi)$-matrix, where $\phi=\omega t$ is
time-dependent while $\theta$ is time-independent. This in turn allows us to
investigate the Berry phase in the entanglement space.
