Efficiency of thin film photocells
  We propose a new concept for the design of high-efficiency photocells based
on ultra-thin (submicron) semiconductor films of controlled thickness. Using a
microscopic model of a thin dielectric layer interacting with incident
electromagnetic radiation we evaluate the efficiency of conversion of solar
radiation into the electric power. We determine the optimal range of parameters
which maximize the efficiency of such photovoltaic element.
