The small deviations of many-dimensional diffusion processes and
  rarefaction by boundaries
  We lead the algorithm of expansion of sojourn probability of many-dimensional
diffusion processes in small domain. The principal member of this expansion
defines normalizing coefficient for special limit theorems.
