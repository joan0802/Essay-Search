Galactic Wind Signatures around High Redshift Galaxies
  We carry out cosmological chemodynamical simulations with different strengths
of supernova (SN) feedback and study how galactic winds from star-forming
galaxies affect the features of hydrogen (HI) and metal (CIV and OVI)
absorption systems in the intergalactic medium at high redshift. We find that
the outflows tend to escape to low density regions, and hardly affect the dense
filaments visible in HI absorption. As a result, the strength of HI absorption
near galaxies is not reduced by galactic winds, but even slightly increases. We
also find that a lack of HI absorption for lines of sight (LOS) close to
galaxies, as found by Adelberger et al., can be created by hot gas around the
galaxies induced by accretion shock heating. In contrast to HI, metal
absorption systems are sensitive to the presence of winds. The models without
feedback can produce the strong CIV and OVI absorption lines in LOS within 50
kpc from galaxies, while strong SN feedback is capable of creating strong CIV
and OVI lines out to about twice that distance. We also analyze the mean
transmissivity of HI, CIV, and OVI within 1 h$^{-1}$ Mpc from star-forming
galaxies. The probability distribution of the transmissivity of HI is
independent of the strength of SN feedback, but strong feedback produces LOS
with lower transmissivity of metal lines. Additionally, strong feedback can
produce strong OVI lines even in cases where HI absorption is weak. We conclude
that OVI is probably the best tracer for galactic winds at high redshift.
