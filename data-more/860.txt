Empirical analysis and statistical modeling of attack processes based on
  honeypots
  Honeypots are more and more used to collect data on malicious activities on
the Internet and to better understand the strategies and techniques used by
attackers to compromise target systems. Analysis and modeling methodologies are
needed to support the characterization of attack processes based on the data
collected from the honeypots. This paper presents some empirical analyses based
on the data collected from the Leurr{\'e}.com honeypot platforms deployed on
the Internet and presents some preliminary modeling studies aimed at fulfilling
such objectives.
