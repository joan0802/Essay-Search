Experimental modeling of physical laws
  A physical law is represented by the probability distribution of a measured
variable. The probability density is described by measured data using an
estimator whose kernel is the instrument scattering function. The experimental
information and data redundancy are defined in terms of information entropy.
The model cost function, comprised of data redundancy and estimation error, is
minimized by the creation-annihilation process.
