Effective interactions from q-deformed inspired transformations
  From the mass term for the transformed quark fields, we obtain effective
contact interactions of the NJL type. The parameters of the model that maps a
system of non-interacting transformed fields into quarks interacting via NJL
contact terms are discussed.
