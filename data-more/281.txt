On Punctured Pragmatic Space-Time Codes in Block Fading Channel
  This paper considers the use of punctured convolutional codes to obtain
pragmatic space-time trellis codes over block-fading channel. We show that good
performance can be achieved even when puncturation is adopted and that we can
still employ the same Viterbi decoder of the convolutional mother code by using
approximated metrics without increasing the complexity of the decoding
operations.
