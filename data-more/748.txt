Binary Systems as Test-beds of Gravity Theories
  We review the general relativistic theory of the motion, and of the timing,
of binary systems containing compact objects (neutron stars or black holes).
Then we indicate the various ways one can use binary pulsar data to test the
strong-field and/or radiative aspects of General Relativity, and of general
classes of alternative theories of relativistic gravity.
