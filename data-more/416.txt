Thermodynamic Stability - A note on a footnote in Ruelle's book
  Thermodynamic stable interaction pair potentials which are not of the form
``positive function + real continuous function of positive type'' are presented
in dimension one. Construction of such a potential in dimension two is
sketched. These constructions use only elementary calculations. The
mathematical background is discussed separately.
