A generalization of Chebyshev polynomials and non rooted posets
  In this paper we give a generalization of Chebyshev polynomials and using
this we describe the M\"obius function of the generalized subword order from a
poset {a1,...as,c |ai<c}, which contains an affirmative answer for the
conjecture by Bj\"orner, Sagan, Vatter.[5,10]
