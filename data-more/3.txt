A determinant of Stirling cycle numbers counts unlabeled acyclic
  single-source automata
  We show that a determinant of Stirling cycle numbers counts unlabeled acyclic
single-source automata. The proof involves a bijection from these automata to
certain marked lattice paths and a sign-reversing involution to evaluate the
determinant.
