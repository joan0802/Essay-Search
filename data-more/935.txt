Analytic solutions for marginal deformations in open superstring field
  theory
  We extend the calculable analytic approach to marginal deformations recently
developed in open bosonic string field theory to open superstring field theory
formulated by Berkovits. We construct analytic solutions to all orders in the
deformation parameter when operator products made of the marginal operator and
the associated superconformal primary field are regular.
