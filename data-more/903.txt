The Use of Weighting in Periodicity Searches in All-Sky Monitor Data:
  Applications to the GLAST LAT
  The light curves produced by all-sky monitors, such as the Rossi X-ray Timing
Explorer All-Sky Monitor and the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT), generally
have non-uniform error bars. In searching for periodic modulation in this type
of data using power spectra it can be important to use appropriate weighting of
data points to achieve the best sensitivity. It was recently demonstrated that
for Swift BAT data a simple weighting scheme can actually sometimes reduce the
sensitivity of the power spectrum depending on source brightness. Instead, a
modified weighting scheme, based on the Cochran semi-weighted mean, gives
improved results independent of source brightness. We investigate the benefits
of weighting power spectra in period searches using simulated GLAST LAT
observations of gamma-ray binaries.
