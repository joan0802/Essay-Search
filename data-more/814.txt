Exchange of quantum states between coupled oscillators
  Exchange of quantum states between two interacting harmonic oscillator along
their evolution time is discussed. It is analyzed the conditions for such
exchange starting from a generic initial state and demonstrating that the
effect occurs exactly only for the particular states C0|0>+Cn|N>, which
includes the interesting qubits components |0>,|1>. It is also determined the
relation between the coupling constant and characteristic frequencies of the
oscillators to have the complete exchange.
