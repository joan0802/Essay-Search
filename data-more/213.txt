A schematic model of scattering in PT-symmetric Quantum Mechanics
  One-dimensional scattering problem admitting a complex, PT-symmetric
short-range potential V(x) is considered. Using a Runge-Kutta-discretized
version of Schroedinger equation we derive the formulae for the reflection and
transmission coefficients and emphasize that the only innovation emerges in
fact via a complexification of one of the potential-characterizing parameters.
