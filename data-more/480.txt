The few scales of nuclei and nuclear matter
  The well-known correlations of low-energy three and four-nucleon observables
with a typical three-nucleon scale (e.g., the Tjon line) is extended to light
nuclei and nuclear matter. Evidence for the scaling between light nuclei
binding energies and the triton one are pointed out. We argue that the
saturation energy and density of nuclear matter are correlated to the triton
binding energy. The available systematic nuclear matter calculations indicate a
possible band structure representing these correlations.
