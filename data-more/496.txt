Penalization approach for mixed hyperbolic systems with constant
  coefficients satisfying a Uniform Lopatinski Condition
  In this paper, we describe a new, systematic and explicit way of
approximating solutions of mixed hyperbolic systems with constant coefficients
satisfying a Uniform Lopatinski Condition via different Penalization
approaches.
