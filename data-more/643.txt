On the HOMFLY and Tutte polynomials
  A celebrated result of F. Jaeger states that the Tutte polynomial of a planar
graph is determined by the HOMFLY polynomial of an associated link. Here we are
interested in the converse of this result. We consider the question `to what
extent does the Tutte polynomial determine the HOMFLY polynomial of any knot?'
We show that the HOMFLY polynomial of a knot is determined by Tutte polynomials
of plane graphs associated to the knot.
