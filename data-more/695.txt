Phonon instability and structural phase transition in Vanadium under
  high pressure
  Results of the first-principles calculations are presented for the group-VB
metals V, Nb and Ta up to couple of megabar pressure. An unique structural
phase transition sequence BCC-->(at 60 GPa) rhombohedral (angle=110.5
degree)-->(at ~ 160 GPa)rhombohedral(angle=108.5 degree)--> (at ~ 430 GPa) BCC
is predicted in V. We also find that BCC-V becomes mechanically and
vibrationally unstable at around 112 GPa pressure. Similar transitions are
absent in Nb and Ta.
