On the (3,N) Maurer-Cartan equation
  Deformations of the 3-differential of 3-differential graded algebras are
controlled by the (3,N) Maurer-Cartan equation. We find explicit formulae for
the coefficients appearing in that equation, introduce new geometric examples
of N-differential graded algebras, and use these results to study N Lie
algebroids.
