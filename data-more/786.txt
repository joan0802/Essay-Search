Convergence of a finite volume scheme for the incompressible fluids
  We consider a finite volume scheme for the two-dimensional incompressible
Navier-Stokes equations. We use a triangular mesh. The unknowns for the
velocity and pressure are respectively piecewise constant and affine. We use a
projection method to deal with the incompressibility constraint. In a former
paper, the stability of the scheme has been proven. We infer from it its
convergence.
