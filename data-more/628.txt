Measurement of the Decay Constant $f_D{_S^+}$ using $D_S^+ --> ell^+ nu
  We measure the decay constant fDs using the Ds -> l+ nu channel, where the l+
designates either a mu+ or a tau+, when the tau+ -> pi+ nu. Using both
measurements we find fDs = 274 +-13 +- 7 MeV. Combining with our previous
determination of fD+, we compute the ratio fDs/fD+ = 1.23 +- 0.11 +- 0.04. We
compare with theoretical estimates.
