Some combinatorial aspects of differential operation compositions on
  space $R^n$
  In this paper we present a recurrent relation for counting meaningful
compositions of the higher-order differential operations on the space $R^{n}$
(n=3,4,...) and extract the non-trivial compositions of order higher than two.
