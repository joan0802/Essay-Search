Necessary optimality conditions for the calculus of variations on time
  scales
  We study more general variational problems on time scales. Previous results
are generalized by proving necessary optimality conditions for (i) variational
problems involving delta derivatives of more than the first order, and (ii)
problems of the calculus of variations with delta-differential side conditions
(Lagrange problem of the calculus of variations on time scales).
