Domain Wall Dynamics near a Quantum Critical Point
  We study the real-time domain-wall dynamics near a quantum critical point of
the one-dimensional anisotropic ferromagnetic spin 1/2 chain. By numerical
simulation, we find the domain wall is dynamically stable in the
Heisenberg-Ising model. Near the quantum critical point, the width of the
domain wall diverges as $(\Delta -1) ^{-1/2}$.
