Complete Set of Polarization Transfer Observables for the $^{12}{\rm
  C}(p,n)$ Reaction at 296 MeV and 0$^{\circ}$
  A complete set of polarization transfer observables has been measured for the
$^{12}{\rm C}(p,n)$ reaction at $T_p=296 {\rm MeV}$ and $\theta_{\rm
lab}=0^{\circ}$. The total spin transfer $\Sigma(0^{\circ})$ and the observable
$f_1$ deduced from the measured polarization transfer observables indicate that
the spin--dipole resonance at $E_x \simeq 7 {\rm MeV}$ has greater $2^-$
strength than $1^-$ strength, which is consistent with recent experimental and
theoretical studies. The results also indicate a predominance of the spin-flip
and unnatural-parity transition strength in the continuum. The exchange tensor
interaction at a large momentum transfer of $Q \simeq 3.6 {\rm fm}^{-1}$ is
discussed.
