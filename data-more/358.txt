Some properties of the complex Monge-Ampere operator in Cegrell's
  classes and applications
  In this article we will first prove a result about convergence in capacity.
Using the achieved result we will obtain a general decompositon theorem for
complex Monge-Ampere measues which will be used to prove a comparison principle
for the complex Monge-Ampere operator.
