Gravitational Duality Transformations on (A)dS4
  We discuss the implementation of electric-magnetic duality transformations in
four-dimensional gravity linearized around Minkowski or (A)dS4 backgrounds. In
the presence of a cosmological constant duality generically modifies the
Hamiltonian, nevertheless the bulk dynamics is unchanged. We pay particular
attention to the boundary terms generated by the duality transformations and
discuss their implications for holography.
