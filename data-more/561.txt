Frequency modulation Fourier transform spectroscopy
  A new method, FM-FTS, combining Frequency Modulation heterodyne laser
spectroscopy and Fourier Transform Spectroscopy is presented. It provides
simultaneous sensitive measurement of absorption and dispersion profiles with
broadband spectral coverage capabilities. Experimental demonstration is made on
the overtone spectrum of C2H2 in the 1.5 $\mu$m region.
