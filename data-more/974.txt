Recurrence analysis of the Portevin-Le Chatelier effect
  Tensile tests were carried out by deforming polycrystalline samples of
Al-2.5%Mg alloy at room temperature in a wide range of strain rates where the
Portevin-Le Chatelier (PLC) effect was observed. The experimental stress-time
series data have been analyzed using the recurrence analysis technique based on
the Recurrence Plot (RP) and the Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) to
study the change in the dynamical behavior of the PLC effect with the imposed
strain rate. Our study revealed that the RQA is able to detect the unique
crossover phenomenon in the PLC dynamics.
