Dynamics of a quantum phase transition in a ferromagnetic Bose-Einstein
  condensate
  We discuss dynamics of a slow quantum phase transition in a spin-1
Bose-Einstein condensate. We determine analytically the scaling properties of
the system magnetization and verify them with numerical simulations in a one
dimensional model.
