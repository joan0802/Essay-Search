Spectral action on noncommutative torus
  The spectral action on noncommutative torus is obtained, using a
Chamseddine--Connes formula via computations of zeta functions. The importance
of a Diophantine condition is outlined. Several results on holomorphic
continuation of series of holomorphic functions are obtained in this context.
