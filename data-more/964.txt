Separability Criterion for Multipartite Pure States
  In this paper, we give out some effective criterions which can be used to
judge the separability of multipartite pure states. We obtain the relationship
between separability and Schmidt decomposable of multipartite pure states in
Theorem1. The first criterion derived from Theorem2 dose not need the Schmidt
decomposition which is hard to find for multipartite states. Theorem3 is more
profound which can be used to deduce Corollary1 which is one of the main
results in [1]. Finally, we give out an algorithm which can be used to judge
the separability of multipartite pure states effectively.
