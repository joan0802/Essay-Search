Manipulating the rotational properties of a two-component Bose gas
  A rotating, two-component Bose-Einstein condensate is shown to exhibit
vortices of multiple quantization, which are possible due to the interatomic
interactions between the two species. Also, persistent currents are absent in
this system. Finally, the order parameter has a very simple structure for a
range of angular momenta.
