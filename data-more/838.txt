Moduli spaces of rational tropical curves
  This note is devoted to the definition of moduli spaces of rational tropical
curves with n marked points. We show that this space has a structure of a
smooth tropical variety of dimension n-3. We define the Deligne-Mumford
compactification of this space and tropical $\psi$-class divisors.
