Strong decays of charmed baryons
  There has been important experimental progress in the sector of heavy baryons
in the past several years. We study the strong decays of the S-wave, P-wave,
D-wave and radially excited charmed baryons using the $^3P_0$ model. After
comparing the calculated decay pattern and total width with the available data,
we discuss the possible internal structure and quantum numbers of those charmed
baryons observed recently.
