Black hole puncture initial data with realistic gravitational wave
  content
  We present improved post-Newtonian-inspired initial data for non-spinning
black-hole binaries, suitable for numerical evolution with punctures. We
revisit the work of Tichy et al. [W. Tichy, B. Bruegmann, M. Campanelli, and P.
Diener, Phys. Rev. D 67, 064008 (2003)], explicitly calculating the remaining
integral terms. These terms improve accuracy in the far zone and, for the first
time, include realistic gravitational waves in the initial data. We investigate
the behavior of these data both at the center of mass and in the far zone,
demonstrating agreement of the transverse-traceless parts of the new metric
with quadrupole-approximation waveforms. These data can be used for numerical
evolutions, enabling a direct connection between the merger waveforms and the
post-Newtonian inspiral waveforms.
