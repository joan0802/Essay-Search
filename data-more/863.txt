Redshifts of the Long Gamma-Ray Bursts
  The low energy spectra of some gamma-ray bursts' show excess components
beside the power-law dependence. The consequences of such a feature allows to
estimate the gamma photometric redshift of the long gamma-ray bursts in the
BATSE Catalog. There is good correlation between the measured optical and the
estimated gamma photometric redshifts. The estimated redshift values for the
long bright gamma-ray bursts are up to z=4, while for the the faint long bursts
- which should be up to z=20 - the redshifts cannot be determined unambiguously
with this method. The redshift distribution of all the gamma-ray bursts with
known optical redshift agrees quite well with the BATSE based gamma photometric
redshift distribution.
