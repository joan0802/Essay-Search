Protein and ionic surfactants - promoters and inhibitors of contact line
  pinning
  We report a new effect of surfactants in pinning a drop contact line,
specifically that lysozyme promotes while lauryl sulfate inhibits pinning. We
explain the pinning disparity assuming difference in wetting: the protein-laden
drop wets a "clean" surface and the surfactant-laden drop wets an
auto-precursored surface.
