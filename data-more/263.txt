Gluon Radiation of an Expanding Color Skyrmion in the Quark-Gluon Plasma
  The density of states and energy spectrum of the gluon radiation are
calculated for the color current of an expanding hydrodynamic skyrmion in the
quark gluon plasma with a semiclassical method. Results are compared with those
in literatures.
