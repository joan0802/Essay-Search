$C^r$-Lohner algorithm
  We present a Lohner type algorithm for the computation of rigorous bounds for
solutions of ordinary differential equations and its derivatives with respect
to initial conditions up to arbitrary order. As an application we prove the
existence of multiple invariant tori around some elliptic periodic orbits for
the pendulum equation with periodic forcing and for Michelson system.
