Circuit QED with a Flux Qubit Strongly Coupled to a Coplanar
  Transmission Line Resonator
  We propose a scheme for circuit quantum electrodynamics with a
superconducting flux-qubit coupled to a high-Q coplanar resonator. Assuming
realistic circuit parameters we predict that it is possible to reach the strong
coupling regime. Routes to metrological applications, such as single photon
generation and quantum non-demolition measurements are discussed.
