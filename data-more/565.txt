Canonical singular hermitian metrics on relative canonical bundles
  We introduce a new class of canonical AZD's (called the supercanonical AZD's)
on the canonical bundles of smooth projective varieties with pseudoeffective
canonical classes. We study the variation of the supercanonical AZD
$\hat{h}_{can}$ under projective deformations and give a new proof of the
invariance of plurigenera.
