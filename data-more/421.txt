Polarization conversion in a silica microsphere
  We experimentally demonstrate controlled polarization-selective phenomena in
a whispering gallery mode resonator. We observed efficient ($\approx 75 %$)
polarization conversion of light in a silica microsphere coupled to a tapered
optical fiber with proper optimization of the polarization of the propagating
light. A simple model treating the microsphere as a ring resonator provides a
good fit to the observed behavior.
