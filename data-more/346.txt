Resolvent estimates related with a class of dispersive equations
  We present a simple proof of the resolvent estimates of elliptic Fourier
multipliers on the Euclidean space, and apply them to the analysis of
time-global and spatially-local smoothing estimates of a class of dispersive
equations. For this purpose we study in detail the properties of the
restriction of Fourier transform on the unit cotangent sphere associated with
the symbols of multipliers.
