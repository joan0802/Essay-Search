White dwarf masses derived from planetary nebulae modelling
  We compare the mass distribution of central stars of planetary nebulae (CSPN)
with those of their progeny, white dwarfs (WD). We use a dynamical method to
measure masses with an uncertainty of 0.02 M$_\odot$. The CSPN mass
distribution is sharply peaked at $0.61 \rm M_\odot$. The WD distribution peaks
at lower masses ($0.58 \rm M_\odot$) and shows a much broader range of masses.
Some of the difference can be explained if the early post-AGB evolution is
faster than predicted by the Bl\"ocker tracks. Between 30 and 50 per cent of WD
may avoid the PN phase because of too low mass. However, the discrepancy cannot
be fully resolved and WD mass distributions may have been broadened by
observational or model uncertainties.
