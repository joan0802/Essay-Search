CP violation due to multi Froggatt-Nielsen fields
  We study how to incorporate CP violation in the Froggatt--Nielsen (FN)
mechanism. To this end, we introduce non-renormalizable interactions with a
flavor democratic structure to the fermion mass generation sector. It is found
that at least two iso-singlet scalar fields with imposed a discrete symmetry
are necessary to generate CP violation due to the appearance of the relative
phase between their vacuum expectation values.
  In the simplest model, ratios of quark masses and the
Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix including the CP violating phase are
determined by the CKM element |V_{us}| and the ratio of two vacuum expectation
values R=|R|e^{i*alpha} (a magnitude and a phase). It is demonstrated how the
angles phi_i (i=1--3) of the unitarity triangle and the CKM off-diagonal
elements |V_{ub}| and |V_{cb}| are predicted as a function of |V_{us}|, |R| and
\alpha. Although the predicted value of the CP violating phase does not agree
with the experimental data within the simplest model, the basic idea of our
scenario would be promising to construct a more realistic model of flavor and
CP violation.
