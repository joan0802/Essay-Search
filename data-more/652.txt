`St\"uckelberg interferometry' with ultracold molecules
  We report on the realization of a time-domain `St\"uckelberg interferometer',
which is based on the internal state structure of ultracold Feshbach molecules.
Two subsequent passages through a weak avoided crossing between two different
orbital angular momentum states in combination with a variable hold time lead
to high-contrast population oscillations. This allows for a precise
determination of the energy difference between the two molecular states. We
demonstrate a high degree of control over the interferometer dynamics. The
interferometric scheme provides new possibilities for precision measurements
with ultracold molecules.
