Bianchi Type I Massive String Magnetized Barotropic Perfect Fluid
  Cosmological Model in General Relativity
  Bianchi type I massive string cosmological model with magnetic field of
barotropic perfect fluid distribution through the techniques used by Latelier
and Stachel, is investigated. To get the deterministic model of the universe,
it is assumed that the universe is filled with barotropic perfect fluid
distribution. The magnetic field is due to electric current produced along
x-axis with infinite electrical conductivity. The behaviour of the model in
presence and absence of magnetic field together with other physical aspects is
further discussed.
