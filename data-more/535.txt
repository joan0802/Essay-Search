Binaries, microquasars and GLAST
  Radio and X-ray observations of the relativistic jets of microquasars show
evidence for the acceleration of particles to very high energies. Signatures of
non-thermal processes occurring closer in to the compact object can also be
found. In addition, three binaries are now established emitters of high (> 100
MeV) and/or very high (> 100GeV) energy gamma-rays. High-energy emission can
originate from a microquasar jet (accretion-powered) or from a shocked pulsar
wind (rotation-powered). I discuss the impact GLAST will have in the very near
future on studies of such binaries. GLAST is expected to shed new light on the
link between accretion and ejection in microquasars and to enable to probe
pulsar winds on small scales in rotation-powered binaries.
