Symmetries by base substitutions in the genetic code predict 2' or 3'
  aminoacylation of tRNAs
  This letter reports complete sets of two-fold symmetries between partitions
of the universal genetic code. By substituting bases at each position of the
codons according to a fixed rule, it happens that properties of the degeneracy
pattern or of tRNA aminoacylation specificity are exchanged.
