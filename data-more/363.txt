B --> rho K* decays and other rare vector-vector modes
  The recent analyses of the following rare vector-vector decays of the B meson
are presented: rho K*, omega K*, omega rho, omega omega, and omega phi
charmless final states. The latest results indicate that the fraction of
longitudinal polarization is about 0.5 in penguin-dominated modes and close to
1 for tree-dominated modes.
