Two- and three-point Green's functions in two-dimensional Landau-gauge
  Yang-Mills theory
  The ghost and gluon propagator and the ghost-gluon and three-gluon vertex of
two-dimensional SU(2) Yang-Mills theory in (minimal) Landau gauge are studied
using lattice gauge theory. It is found that the results are qualitatively
similar to the ones in three and four dimensions. The propagators and the
Faddeev-Popov operator behave as expected from the Gribov-Zwanziger scenario.
In addition, finite volume effects affecting these Green's functions are
investigated systematically. The critical infrared exponents of the
propagators, as proposed in calculations using stochastic quantization and
Dyson-Schwinger equations, are confirmed quantitatively. For this purpose
lattices of volume up to (42.7 fm)^2 have been used.
