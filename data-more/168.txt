Very strong and slowly varying magnetic fields as source of axions
  The investigation on the production of particles in slowly varying but
extremely intense magnetic field in extended to the case of axions. The
motivation is, as for some previously considered cases, the possibility that
such kind of magnetic field may exist around very compact astrophysical
objects.
