Monitoring spatially heterogeneous dynamics in a drying colloidal thin
  film
  We report on a new type of experiment that enables us to monitor spatially
and temporally heterogeneous dynamic properties in complex fluids. Our approach
is based on the analysis of near-field speckles produced by light diffusely
reflected from the superficial volume of a strongly scattering medium. By
periodic modulation of an incident speckle beam we obtain pixel-wise ensemble
averages of the structure function coefficient, a measure of the dynamic
activity. To illustrate the application of our approach we follow the different
stages in the drying process of a colloidal thin film. We show that we can
access ensemble averaged dynamic properties on length scales as small as ten
micrometers over the full field of view.
