Kinks and Particles in Non-integrable Quantum Field Theories
  In this talk we discuss an elementary derivation of the semi-classical
spectrum of neutral particles in two field theories with kink excitations. We
also show that, in the non-integrable cases, each vacuum state cannot
generically support more than two stable particles, since all other neutral
exitations are resonances, which will eventually decay.
