The dissolution of the vacancy gas and grain boundary diffusion in
  crystalline solids
  Based on the formula for the number density of vacancies in a solid under the
stress or tension, the model of grain boundary diffusion in crystalline solids
is developed. We obtain the activation energy of grain boundary diffusion
(dependent on the surface tension or the energy of the grain boundary) and also
the distributions of vacancies and the diffusing species in the vicinity of the
grain boundary.
