Fusion of radioactive $^{132}$Sn with $^{64}$Ni
  Evaporation residue and fission cross sections of radioactive $^{132}$Sn on
$^{64}$Ni were measured near the Coulomb barrier. A large sub-barrier fusion
enhancement was observed. Coupled-channel calculations including inelastic
excitation of the projectile and target, and neutron transfer are in good
agreement with the measured fusion excitation function. When the change in
nuclear size and shift in barrier height are accounted for, there is no extra
fusion enhancement in $^{132}$Sn+$^{64}$Ni with respect to stable Sn+$^{64}$Ni.
A systematic comparison of evaporation residue cross sections for the fusion of
even $^{112-124}$Sn and $^{132}$Sn with $^{64}$Ni is presented.
