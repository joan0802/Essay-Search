The Blazar Spectral Sequence and GLAST
  The present status and understanding of the "spectral sequence" of blazars is
discussed in the perspective of the upcoming GLAST launch. The vast improvement
in sensitivity will allow to i) determine more objectively the "average"
gamma-ray properties of classes objects ii) probe more deeply the ratio between
accretion power and jet power in different systems.
