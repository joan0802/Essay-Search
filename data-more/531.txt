Effect of transition-metal elements on the electronic properties of
  quasicrystals and complex aluminides
  In this paper, we briefly present our work on the role of transition-metal
element in electronic structure and transport properties of quasicrystals and
related complex phases. Several Parts of these works have been done or
initiated in collaboration with Prof. T. Fujiwara.
