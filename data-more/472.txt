Contrasting Two Transformation-Based Methods for Obtaining Absolute
  Extrema
  In this note we contrast two transformation-based methods to deduce absolute
extrema and the corresponding extremizers. Unlike variation-based methods, the
transformation-based ones of Carlson and Leitmann and the recent one of Silva
and Torres are direct in that they permit obtaining solutions by inspection.
