Vortex-induced topological transition of the bilinear-biquadratic
  Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the triangular lattice
  The ordering of the classical Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the triangular
lattice with the the bilinear-biquadratic interaction is studied by Monte Carlo
simulations. It is shown that the model exhibits a topological phase transition
at a finite-temperature driven by topologically stable vortices, while the spin
correlation length remains finite even at and below the transition point. The
relevant vortices could be of three different types, depending on the value of
the biquadratic coupling. Implications to recent experiments on the triangular
antiferromagnet NiGa$_2$S$_4$ is discussed.
