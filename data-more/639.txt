Skew-Hadamard matrices of orders 188 and 388 exist
  We construct several difference families on cyclic groups of orders 47 and
97, and use them to construct skew-Hadamard matrices of orders 188 and 388.
Such difference families and matrices are constructed here for the first time.
The matrices are constructed by using the Goethals-Seidel array.
