An S_3-symmetric Littlewood-Richardson rule
  The classical Littlewood-Richardson coefficients C(lambda,mu,nu) carry a
natural $S_3$ symmetry via permutation of the indices. Our "carton rule" for
computing these numbers transparently and uniformly explains these six
symmetries; previously formulated Littlewood-Richardson rules manifest at most
three of the six.
