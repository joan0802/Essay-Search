Average optimality for risk-sensitive control with general state space
  This paper deals with discrete-time Markov control processes on a general
state space. A long-run risk-sensitive average cost criterion is used as a
performance measure. The one-step cost function is nonnegative and possibly
unbounded. Using the vanishing discount factor approach, the optimality
inequality and an optimal stationary strategy for the decision maker are
established.
