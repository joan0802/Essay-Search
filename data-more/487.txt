Teleparallel Version of the Stationary Axisymmetric Solutions and their
  Energy Contents
  This work contains the teleparallel version of the stationary axisymmetric
solutions. We obtain the tetrad and the torsion fields representing these
solutions. The tensor, vector and axial-vector parts of the torsion tensor are
evaluated. It is found that the axial-vector has component only along $\rho$
and $z$ directions. The three possibilities of the axial vector depending on
the metric function $B$ are discussed. The vector related with spin has also
been evaluated and the corresponding extra Hamiltonian is furnished. Further,
we use the teleparallel version of M$\ddot{o}$ller prescription to find the
energy-momentum distribution of the solutions. It is interesting to note that
(for $\lambda=1$) energy and momentum densities in teleparallel theory are
equal to the corresponding quantities in GR plus an additional quantity in
each, which may become equal under certain conditions. Finally, we discuss the
two special cases of the stationary axisymmetric solutions.
