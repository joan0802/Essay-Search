Actions for the Bosonic String with the Curved Worldsheet
  At first we introduce an action for the string, which leads to a worldsheet
that always is curved. For this action we study the Poincar\'e symmetry and the
associated conserved currents. Then, a generalization of the above action,
which contains an arbitrary function of the two-dimensional scalar curvature,
will be introduced. An extra scalar field enables us to modify these actions to
Weyl invariant models.
