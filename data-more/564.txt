The Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner equation for reaction-controlled kinetics
  We rigorously derive a weak form of the Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner equation as
the homogenization limit of a Stefan-type problem describing
reaction-controlled coarsening of a large number of small spherical particles.
Moreover, we deduce that the effective mean-field description holds true in the
particular limit of vanishing surface-area density of particles.
