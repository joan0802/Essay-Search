Flavor Physics in SUSY at large tan(beta)
  We discuss the phenomenological impact of a particularly interesting corner
of the MSSM: the large tan(beta) regime. The capabilities of leptonic and
hadronic Flavor Violating processes in shedding light on physics beyond the
Standard Model are reviewed. Moreover, we show that tests of Lepton
Universality in charged current processes can represent an interesting handle
to obtain relevant information on New Physics scenarios.
