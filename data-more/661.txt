Bounds for Multiplicities of Unitary Representations of Cohomological
  Type in Spaces of Cusp Forms
  Let $\Goo$ be a semisimple real Lie group with unitary dual $\Ghat$. The goal
of this note is to produce new upper bounds for the multiplicities with which
representations $\pi \in \Ghat$ of cohomological type appear in certain spaces
of cusp forms on $\Goo$.
