Mixed chemistry phenomenon during late stages of stellar evolution
  We discuss phenomenon of simultaneous presence of O- and C-based material in
surroundings of evolutionary advanced stars. We concentrate on silicate carbon
stars and present observations that directly confirm the binary model scenario
for them. We discuss also class of C-stars with OH emission detected, to which
some [WR] planetary nebulae do belong.
