Towards self-consistent definition of instanton liquid parameters
  The possibility of self-consistent determination of instanton liquid
parameters is discussed together with the definition of optimal pseudo-particle
configurations and comparing the various pseudo-particle ensembles. The
weakening of repulsive interactions between pseudo-particles is argued and
estimated.
