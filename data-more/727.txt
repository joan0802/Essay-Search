Zero bias anomaly out of equilibrium
  The non-equilibrium zero bias anomaly (ZBA) in the tunneling density of
states of a diffusive metallic film is studied. An effective action describing
virtual fluctuations out-of-equilibrium is derived. The singular behavior of
the equilibrium ZBA is smoothed out by real processes of inelastic scattering.
