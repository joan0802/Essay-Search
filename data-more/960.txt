On the orbital period of the magnetic Cataclysmic Variable HS 0922+1333
  Context: The object HS 0922+1333 was visited briefly in 2002 in a mini survey
of low accretion rate polars (LARPs) in order to test if they undergo high
luminosity states similar to ordinary polars. On the basis of that short
observation the suspicion arose that the object might be an asynchronous polar
(Tovmassian et al. 2004). The disparity between the presumed orbital and spin
period appeared to be quite unusual. Aims: We performed follow-up observations
of the object to resolve the problem. Methods: New simultaneous spectroscopic
and photometric observations spanning several years allowed measurements of
radial velocities of emission and absorption lines from the secondary star and
brightness variations due to synchrotron emission from the primary. Results:
New observations show that the object is actually synchronous and its orbital
and spin period are equal to 4.04 hours. Conclusions: We identify the source of
confusion of previous observations to be a high velocity component of emission
line arousing from the stream of matter leaving L1 point.
