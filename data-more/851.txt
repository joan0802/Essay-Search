Bose-Einstein correlations of direct photons in Au+Au collisions at
  $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV
  The current status of the analysis of direct photon Bose-Einstein
correlations in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV done by the PHENIX
collaboration is summarized. All possible sources of distortion of the
two-photon correlation function are discussed and methods to control them in
the PHENIX experiment are presented.
