Orthogonality criterion for banishing hydrino states from standard
  quantum mechanics
  Orthogonality criterion is used to shown in a very simple and general way
that anomalous bound-state solutions for the Coulomb potential (hydrino states)
do not exist as bona fide solutions of the Schr\"{o}dinger, Klein-Gordon and
Dirac equations.
