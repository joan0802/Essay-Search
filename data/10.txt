Computing genus 2 Hilbert-Siegel modular forms over $\Q(\sqrt{5})$ via
  the Jacquet-Langlands correspondence
  In this paper we present an algorithm for computing Hecke eigensystems of
Hilbert-Siegel cusp forms over real quadratic fields of narrow class number
one. We give some illustrative examples using the quadratic field
$\Q(\sqrt{5})$. In those examples, we identify Hilbert-Siegel eigenforms that
are possible lifts from Hilbert eigenforms.
