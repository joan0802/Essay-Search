A Note About the {Ki(z)} Functions
  In the article [Petojevic 2006], A. Petojevi\' c verified useful properties
of the $K_{i}(z)$ functions which generalize Kurepa's [Kurepa 1971] left
factorial function. In this note, we present simplified proofs of two of these
results and we answer the open question stated in [Petojevic 2006]. Finally, we
discuss the differential transcendency of the $K_{i}(z)$ functions.
